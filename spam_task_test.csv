RE: Comrade Communism (was Re: Crony Capitalism (was RE: sed    /s/United States/Roman Empire/g))First, misattribution.  I did not write the blurb below.  I made onestatement about VP Cheney only, to wit, that he has a short memory.I couldn't agree with you more on this: "in short, then, economics is not azero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backsof the poor, and redistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshitis just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise," however, I resent being lumpedin a zero-sum-zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich andsuccessful at face value is apropos of nothing and I am beginning tounderstand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my adhominem (re Cheney) align themselves weird sylogisms like "if rich thendeservedly" or "if rich then smarter."  Given that, I am also beginning tounderstand why some people NEED to be rich.WRT to meritocracies - all hail, meritocracies!  WRT Harvard: over 90% of2002 graduates were cum laude +. INTERESTING curve.  Those eager to bemeasured got their wish; those unwashed shy folk who just live it providethe balast.Speaking of Forbes, was reading about Peter Norton just today in an oldissue while waiting for my doctor.

Can you say"Bootstraps", boys and girls? I knew you could...[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taughtyou in a government-run "high" school, you'll probably get more of*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever getaround to having a good old fashioned government-collapsingtransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer'sgovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind ofinnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west thissummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers outthere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a"terminal" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from thebest school possible.Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over theyears for proof.Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League afterWorld War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* whogoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actuallyafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, whocouldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in thelast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,and "biased" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with "terminal"degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, orlearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and lossbasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life afterdeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb peoplewho don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of thisrhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it tobeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. Youwere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went toMissouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,much less a "terminal" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone onthis list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots witheducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. Thefacts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, andeconomics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, includingignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,intelligence and effort.[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level ofcompetence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,apparently.]BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, andthere would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practicallyall of that "new" money would have come from economic efficiency andnot "stolen" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.That efficiency is called "progress", for those of you in ThePeople's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and betterstuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois conceptapparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'dknow about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increasein general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking aboutextorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone whodoesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of somepolitician as Santa Claus come election time...In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is nottheft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, andredistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit is justthat: horseshit, happy or otherwise.To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marxwrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.Cheers,RAH-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPY511cPxH8jf3ohaEQLAsgCfZhsQMSvUy6GqJ5wgL52DwZKpIhMAnRuRYYboc+IcylP5TlKL58jpwEfu=z877-----END PGP SIGNATURE------------------------R.

Re: Fw: Re: When are we going to get. [making ALSA rpms]Thanks for this information.  I gave Alsa a try, couldn't figure out howto enable digital out, although I'm sure if I put enough time into it,could have gotten it working.  Also when playing mp3s in analog mode,every time I switched between mp3s there was a bit of static.  Noticed anew distribution geared towards audio applications, AGNULA(http://www.agnula.org/) uses Alsa as well.  Seems though the latestopen source emu10k1 drivers (SBLive! 5.1) work fair enough.  Anyone elseexperience these problems with Alsa?

Immediate Reply NeededDear Sir,I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contractaward and review committee set up by the federalgovernment of Nigeria under the new civiliandispensation to award new contracts and reviewexisting ones.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable andreputable person to handle a very confidentialtransaction, which involves the transfer of a hugesum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry infavor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sumof US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand UnitedState Dollars). This amount has now been approved andis now ready to be transferred being that thecompaniesthat actually executed these contracts have beenfully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account forsubsequent disbursement, since we as civil servantsare prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civilservice law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trustreposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside forincidental expenses (internal and external) betweenboth parties in the course of the transaction you willbe mandated to remit the balance to other accountsin due course. Modalities have been worked out at the highest levelof the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fundswithin 7 working days subject to your satisfaction ofthe above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves andfor mutual security of the funds the whole approvalprocedures will officially and legally processedwith your name or the name of any company you maynominate as the bonefide beneficiary. Once more I want you to understand that having putin over twenty-five years in the civil service of mycountry, I am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated withutmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assistby sending me a reply to this email to state your position on thistransaction, if favorable we will take further stepsto brief you the full details of this viable transaction. I want to assure you that this business proposal is100% risk free as we have done our homeworkproperly. I quite believe that you will protect our interestby taking this deal strictly confidential, as we arestill in government service, which we intend toretire from in full honor.Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule toenable us include this transfer in the next batchwhich would constitute the new quarter paymentsfor the 2002 financial year. Thank you and God bless.Dr James Alabi	1

Microsoft buys XDegress - more of a p2p/distributed data thing...I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html"Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to runon the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could berun on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the fieldstarted demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGIand mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose togo back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let theclient do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in oneimportant detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page isloaded, as JavaScript functions do.And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can accessXDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using theirbrowser."==="Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes anew naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figuredout mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users andbillions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location ofservers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamaidoes), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default"home" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-houseapplications.""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around theInternet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees ismore sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidthconnections can download portions, or "stripes," of a file from severalcached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassemblesthese stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify thatthe downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of thisdigital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP headerfor the file."	0

WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)Dear Sir, I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit of both of us. The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was lodged into a security company here in the Country by the late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled aspersonal belongings and as such the security company does not know the true content of the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used for his political campaign. Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest.As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security Company to move this money as a consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore affiliated office where you will be required to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund. If you are interested to carry out this transaction with me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general expenses, and 75% for us.You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction also which will be used to effect the change of ownership of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the consignment.Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy communication Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 (seven) working days.I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana {SAN} ______________________________________________________Bo=EEte aux lettres - Caramail - http://www.caramail.com	1

Wall Street's dirty little secret ...It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle schoolwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in thecafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just madethem a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,"and I'll bring you five dollars next week."  The investmentwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing theirlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course when "next week" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,I promised to pay them even more the week after that,if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high schoolstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're notgoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out whenyou're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors andmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time tobuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keepyour money in the market, the more money you're going to make.Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is"NEVER".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an indexfund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollarsin thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard tomake use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars inthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where wouldyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatilityis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to seethose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followedby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don'tcare if the market went up or down 20% this year as longit was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successfultrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxingring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as helldon't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firmto execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in factso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spenda few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publicationsduring the past decade, and after using day tradingto successfully make more than four million dollars inthe stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't becomewealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is throughhard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeksbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practicalexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pullingclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to sharewith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn frommy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,secret formula for day trading that I've used profitablyyear after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost withinminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make.*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** Profit on huge intraday price swings.*** Make money on the biggest news stories.*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximumreturns. *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street professionals use.*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind.

[IRR] Klez: The Virus That  Won't DieKlez: The Virus That Won't Die Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.Andrew Brandt>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazinePosted Thursday, August 01, 2002The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific virus ever.And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry other viruses in them that corrupt your data....http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,103259,00.asp_______________________________________________Irregulars mailing listIrregulars@tb.tfhttp://tb.tf/mailman/listinfo/irregulars	0
Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and EvilOne of the most bizarre pages I've seen on the Web. At first I thought itmight be some sort of back-story to a RPG, but, nope, it looks like somebodybelieves this.===http://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htmM09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking ontheir hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears inRemote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linkedtogether and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoidderivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entitieswith little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is adescription of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people seethem. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, butnot the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Eartheven if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have arenal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.The definitive work on dragons is "The Flight of Dragons" by PeterDickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the longbow. Targets do not come much bigger.Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is thatthere were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guardtheir eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. Theysurvived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slavesbut otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of thedinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and alsoto appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remoteviewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds arecontagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can beencouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians andmind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will helpso called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have greatdifficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should removeall perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source ofSatanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thusif we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that ofall other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of theirpsi.THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears tohold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles ofrotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for younghatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which madethem very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order tokeep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do thisthey had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is anact of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop theability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first andso their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They havebecome the source of all Satans, devils and demons.Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keepthem warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) andonly starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tendto hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This isprimarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is notsuitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,even if they are standing on ice.Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an actof love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian femalecan not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a birdsitting on a nest.Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hateall enemies of their young, but this is secondary.If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, thenpurge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of ourreligions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends toconcentrate on "How to Brainwash your Neighbour". Conscious thought hasbuilt many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using"How to care for and protect one's young" as a foundation.Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something "A load ofdinosaur's eggs". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entitytends to purge all malice back to its roots.It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist onvampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing theserenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must takecontrol or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for thefollowing.Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killinghormones, abilities, etc.Mind machines.The original engraving or engram.GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. They appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were thefirst job holders.TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start oftime.My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, GalacticSubconscious, etc.EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Wheneverone hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that thehigher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like orother basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.Every extinct race, etc.BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down viagenetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.	0

URGENT ASSISTANCE(CONFIDENTIAL)Dear sir,,My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. TheoDuba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from SouthAfrican Information exchange Johannesburg..Due to the previous war against white farmers inZimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supportersto claim all the white owned farms in our country, heordered all the White owned farmers to surrender alltheir farms to his party members and his followers. Myfather was a victim of this oppression and inhumanbehavior as he was one of the richest farmers in ourcountry,my fayher was totaly against the act by thepresidnt MUGABE. The presidents supporters invaded myfathers farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrestedhim and confiscated all his investment.Early last year when this victimization of whitefarmers by president Mugabe started, my late fatherenvisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost allhis money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out ofZimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in aprivate security company through the help of hislawyer here in South Africa without revealing the realcontents of the box to the security company, then,went back home. He registered the box as familytreasure.While he was still in detention that led to his deathdue to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in SouthAfrica because of the escalation of the crisis inZimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. Hewas arrested on the 5th of March last year.Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th ofDecember 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating anddepressing because my fathers lawyer is presentlyhospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;though the lodgment documents are with me, as such Iwant to relocate to your country for good. Presently,my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylumpermit as a refugee.I am seeking for your assistance in transferring themoney in the security company (US$15 Million) out ofthis country to your country for investment. If youthink you can help me, Please try to get in touch withme immediately with the  number below . Yourcompensation/share for assistance will be negotiatedif you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in mycountry is still lingering, please endeavor to keepthis information to yourself and secret, because Iwouldnt want anything that will expose me, and theexistence of this money.Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.Sincerely yours,STEVEN DUBA (DR).TEL:27-83-713-2696__________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Yahoo!

Re: From salon.com - Forbidden thoughts about 9/11From nobody Mon Sep 15 17:59:27 2014Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiI am delurking to comment on the Salon article. I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show "Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.Mike Chris Haun wrote:i though this was all rather interesting, first bit of 9/11 coverage that i've liked.http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2002/09/11/forbidden_letters/index.htmlChris---------------------------------Do you Yahoo!?Yahoo!

Webex EndeavorsWe have a partnership with Webex.  We use their serivcefor cross-firewall app sharing--something that Netmeeting/Messengerand Sametime require a lot of configuration of firewalls,authentications, access controls and user training for.  Now Webex has invites, instant meeting launch without any configuration. Users like it as now they have something to do in between Web conferences and places to store and author documents, reschedule meetings, relaunch meetings.  Webex likes it as people are signed on all the time.  GregSeptember 19, 2002  Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During  and Between Online Meetings  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network  ###  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple  copies of constantly changing documents.  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also  essential.  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,  inside or outside company firewalls.  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or  "present." This enables them to chat and message each other, search across  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.  "In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries," says  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. "The powerful combination  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings."  "WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,  training, support and product design," says David Farrington, vice president  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. "By integrating the  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications."  About Magi  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming  unsecured, "read-only" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical  interface, and universal name spaces generating "follow me URLs" for mobile  professionals.

[ILUG] Using Normal IDE Device with a Dell Latitude CPx laptopHi,I've got an normal 3.5" CD-RW IDE drive that I'd like to be able to use with aDell Latitude CPx laptop that I've got. Does anyone know any way to enable this,for example through the use of a special cable for the Modular Bay (where CD-ROMor floppy drive is normally).There is also the possibility of using a docking station, but Dell's dockingsolution for the Latitude series doesn't seem to allow for the use of an IDEdrive, only SCSI... Unless someone knows of a "non-Dell" solution that'scompatible.Anyone any ideas?Thanks,Darren.-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie	0
NYTimes.com Article: Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will    Survive After AllThis article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.Excellent evidence of the herd. Just imagine if the anonymous noise injected into our world newsphere (noosphere?) was, say, a fraudulent story that a stock accounting scandal had been accused and the evildoers were shorting. Oh, wait, that happened. An unemployed Orange County student took down Emulex...Enjoy!  Rohitkhare@alumni.caltech.eduStop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After AllOctober 2, 2002By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN  Apparently it fell into the category "too good to check."Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that theWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blondswould become extinct within 200 years, because blondnesswas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. Thereports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC Newsprogram "Good Morning America," and on Saturday by CNN. There was only one problem, the health organization said ina statement yesterday that it never reported that blondswould become extinct, and it had never done a study on thesubject. "W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reportsoriginated," said the organization, an agency of the UnitedNations based in Geneva, "but would like to stress that wehave no opinion of the future existence of blonds." All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,cited a study from the World Health Organization - "ablonde-shell study," as The Daily Star of London put it.But none reported any scientific details from the study orthe names of the scientists who conducted it. On "Good Morning America," Charles Gibson began aconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:"There's a study from the World Health Organization, thisis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Womenand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, naturalblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earthwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene asbrunets." Ms. Sawyer said she was "somewhat of a natural blonde."Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said theanchors got the information from an ABC producer in Londonwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. In London, The Sun and The Express both reported thatunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest inScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expectedthe last true blond to hail from Finland. The British accounts were replete with the views ofbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allowblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that raregenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming anendangered species. Journalists in London said last night that the source ofthe reports was probably one of several European newsagencies that are used by the British press, but itremained unclear which one. Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said thereport was probably distributed by The Press Association,Britain's domestic news agency. "Several papers picked itup," he said. But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The PressAssociation, said that although it had considered runningthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talkingto the World Health Organization. "We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to theWorld Health Organization first," she said. "They told usthat report was two years old, and had been covered at thetime. They said it had been picked up again that day by aGerman news agency." She added that she did not know which agency theorganization was referring to.

Kill Your GodsHindus mourn 'monkey god'By Omer FarooqBBC reporter in HyderabadHundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which becamerevered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indianstate of Andhra Pradesh.The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysedAnimal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustionafter being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.It had not eaten for three weeks.Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally inthe presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that themonkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.GarlandedOne animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey hadfailed because of the blind faith of the people.The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animalout of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a monthago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped itaround the clock.'Exploited'Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, asthe temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups ofresidents.But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was beingmistreated.They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had beenforcibly confined in the temple.The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were beingexploited to make money.The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - butvillagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.	0

Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...)...an alternative to the "kind of de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered,mercenary-minded lady available on the British singles scene,"Glad to see American culture is making it's way into the British bars too :)God bless us uncivilized bastards, every one.Still, definately something not right about the below. People are nowcheaper then a decent laptop? (ok, so we knew that already)-------------Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in ThailandThu Aug 29,10:19 AM ETBy Andrew MarshallBANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailandlooking for a wife. It took two hours to find her."The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung allmy clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous," he said. "Iknew then there was something special."Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,who is expecting their first child.Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of womenin developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West thatoften turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailandin search of a wife."I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan," he said. "I knew Ifound her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring."Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept intouch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England andthe couple married.MR. MARRIAGELawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agencyMoylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself "Mr. Marriage,"started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introductionagency.Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages."In the last five years we've done about 400," he said. "To the best of myknowledge, they have all been successful."Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries thatrequire them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai womenlooking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch'soffice -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness andlanguage problems."We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,"Lynch said. "But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax."After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to knoweach other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost everyclient has found a potential wife."At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back andthink he hasn't made his mind up," he said. In most cases, marriage follows,usually within the next year.Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, aBangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and lessthan 10 percent have broken up.Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have justarrived in Bangkok looking for a wife."Sometimes they are very nervous," she said. "And sometimes they are veryimpatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calmdown, OK, we'll talk."'But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wifeand get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wivesfor include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumaticstress disorder.WHY?Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Criticssay they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable toform relationships in their own country, and on the desperation ofimpoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there isno reason to object. "If you talk about people who are needy, I thinkeverybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, Ineed Wan," he said."Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's nosecret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problemwith that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care totheir future husband."Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why theychoose to use his agency.His brochure promises an alternative to the "kind of de-feminized,over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the Britishsingles scene," and says he can make dreams come true even for men who arenot "God's gift to women."Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in theirown countries -- and found Thai women attractive."They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discothequesor restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?Impossible," she said."Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They aregood at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different fromladies from other countries."Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are alsonot a major obstacle."Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about havinga husband who is significantly older," Lynch said. "When I met my wife shecouldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phoneticdictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it upvery quickly."Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they moveto the West."We have kitchens, we have study classes," Roongthip said. "We teach themhow to eat, and when to make tea."PITFALLSBut not all dreams come true. "Bee" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went toSwitzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she isback in Bangkok, sad and angry."He had no friends, and I was so lonely," she said. "I tried to make himhappy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He neverspoke to me."Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. "I thought I would be happythere," she said. "But it was the worst time of my life."Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensureunsuitable candidates are weeded out."We are ethical and professional," he said. "We will not take on allcomers."Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof thearrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,looking for a foreign husband."Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,"Moylan said. "But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal."	0
